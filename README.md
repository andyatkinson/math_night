[Slide Deck Link](https://speakerdeck.com/andyatkinson/family-math-careers-night)

This presentation was about 10 minutes long, presented to elementary school students at a STEM elementary school (and their parents), on careers in Math.

I introduced Software Engineering concepts and we played some small demo text games!

## Demos

Putting together some programming demos for kids grades K-5

### Average

Let's write a function to calculate an average

### Rock paper scissors

Let's make a little text program to play rock paper scissors with :)

### Simon Says

### Game Store

Let's make a database and store some games, who owns them.

Maybe the kids can trade games?
